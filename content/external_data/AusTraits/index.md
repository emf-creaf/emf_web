summary: AusTraits synthesises data on 448 traits across 28,640 taxa from field campaigns,
  published literature, taxonomic monographs, and individual taxon descriptions. Traits
  vary in scope from physiological measures of performance (e.g. photosynthetic gas
  exchange, water-use efficiency) to morphological attributes (e.g. leaf area, seed
  mass, plant height) which link to aspects of ecological variation.

## Description

AusTraits synthesises data on 448 traits across 28,640 taxa from field campaigns, published literature, taxonomic monographs, and individual taxon descriptions. Traits vary in scope from physiological measures of performance (e.g. photosynthetic gas exchange, water-use efficiency) to morphological attributes (e.g. leaf area, seed mass, plant height) which link to aspects of ecological variation.
