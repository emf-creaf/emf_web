summary: The Community Land Model is a collaborative project between scientists. The
  model simulates the physical, chemical and biological processes by which terrestrial
  ecosystems affect and are affected by climate across a variety of spatial and temporal
  scales. The model represents several aspects of the land surface, including surface
  heterogeneity and consists of components related to land biogeophysics, hydrological
  cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions and ecosystem dynamics.

## Description

The Community Land Model is a collaborative project between scientists. The model simulates the physical, chemical and biological processes by which terrestrial ecosystems affect and are affected by climate across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The model represents several aspects of the land surface, including surface heterogeneity and consists of components related to land biogeophysics, hydrological cycle, biogeochemistry, human dimensions and ecosystem dynamics.
