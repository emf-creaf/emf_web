summary: ROTH-C is amodel for the turnover of organic carbon in non-waterlogged topsoils
  that allows for the effects of soil type, temperature, moisture and plant cover
  on the turnover precesses. It uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic
  carbon, microbial biomass carbon and delta 14C on a years to centuries timescale.

## Description

ROTH-C is amodel for the turnover of organic carbon in non-waterlogged topsoils that allows for the effects of soil type, temperature, moisture and plant cover on the turnover precesses. It uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and delta 14C on a years to centuries timescale.
