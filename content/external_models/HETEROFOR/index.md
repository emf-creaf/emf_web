summary: HETEROFOR is a spatially-explicit and process-based model describing individual
  tree growth based on resource sharing (light, water and nutrients) in uneven-aged
  and mixed stands. HETEROFOR was progressively elaborated through the integration
  of various modules (light interception, phenology, water cycling, photosynthesis
  and respiration, carbon allocation, mineral nutrition and nutrient cycling).

## Description

HETEROFOR is a spatially-explicit and process-based model describing individual tree growth based on resource sharing (light, water and nutrients) in uneven-aged and mixed stands. HETEROFOR was progressively elaborated through the integration of various modules (light interception, phenology, water cycling, photosynthesis and respiration, carbon allocation, mineral nutrition and nutrient cycling).
