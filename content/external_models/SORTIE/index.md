summary: SORTIE-ND (or just SORTIE) is an individual-based forest simulator designed
  to study neighborhood processes. This means that the trees in the forest are modeled
  individually, not as averages or spatial aggregates. Each individual has a location
  in space. SORTIE specializes in modeling the interactions of trees with their nearest
  neighbors to study local neighborhood dynamics.

## Description

SORTIE-ND (or just SORTIE) is an individual-based forest simulator designed to study neighborhood processes. This means that the trees in the forest are modeled individually, not as averages or spatial aggregates. Each individual has a location in space. SORTIE specializes in modeling the interactions of trees with their nearest neighbors to study local neighborhood dynamics.
