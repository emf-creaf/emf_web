summary: Biome-BGC is an ecosystem model that estimates fluxes and storage of energy,
  water, carbon, and nitrogen for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial
  ecosystems. Processes accounted for are leaf growth, litterfall, sunlight interception,
  rainfall interception, snow accumulation, snowmelt, drainage of soil water, evaporation
  of water from soil and leaves, transpiration, photosynthetic carbon fixation, nitrogen
  uptake, allocation of carbon and nitrogen, decomposition of plant litter and soil
  organic mater, plant mortality and fireThe model uses a daily time-step.

## Description

Biome-BGC is an ecosystem model that estimates fluxes and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial ecosystems. Processes accounted for are leaf growth, litterfall, sunlight interception, rainfall interception, snow accumulation, snowmelt, drainage of soil water, evaporation of water from soil and leaves, transpiration, photosynthetic carbon fixation, nitrogen uptake, allocation of carbon and nitrogen, decomposition of plant litter and soil organic mater, plant mortality and fireThe model uses a daily time-step.
