summary: FORSPACE is a spatially explicit forest gap model that aims to give a realistic
  description of the processes that determine forest dynamics at the scale of a landscape
  (up to thousands of hectares). Gap dynamics in relation to herbivores are an important
  aspects of FORSPACE. FORSPACE tracks cohorts of identical individuals per species.
  The vertical structure is represented by different height cohorts per species.

## Description

FORSPACE is a spatially explicit forest gap model that aims to give a realistic description of the processes that determine forest dynamics at the scale of a landscape (up to thousands of hectares). Gap dynamics in relation to herbivores are an important aspects of FORSPACE. FORSPACE tracks cohorts of identical individuals per species. The vertical structure is represented by different height cohorts per species.
