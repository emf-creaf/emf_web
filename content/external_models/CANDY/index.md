summary: 'The agro-ecosystem model CANDY (Carbon And Nitrogen DYnamics) has been developed
  to describe carbon and nitrogen dynamics in arable soils in order to provide information
  about carbon stocks in soils, organic matter turnover, nitrogen uptake by crops,
  leaching and water quality. The basic process modules are: soil water dynamics,
  soil temperature dynamics, crop development including permanent grassland and livestock,
  soil organic matter turnover and nitrogen dynamics'

## Description

The agro-ecosystem model CANDY (Carbon And Nitrogen DYnamics) has been developed to describe carbon and nitrogen dynamics in arable soils in order to provide information about carbon stocks in soils, organic matter turnover, nitrogen uptake by crops, leaching and water quality. The basic process modules are: soil water dynamics, soil temperature dynamics, crop development including permanent grassland and livestock, soil organic matter turnover and nitrogen dynamics
