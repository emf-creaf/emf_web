summary: IBIS is a comprehensive computer model of the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems
  that simulates a wide variety of ecosystem processes, including energy, water, and
  CO2 exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere, physiological processes of plants
  and soil organisms, vegetation phenology, plant growth and competition, and nutrient
  cycling.
