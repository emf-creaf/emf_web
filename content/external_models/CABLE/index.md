summary: CABLE is a land surface model used to calculate fluxes of momentum, energy,
  water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere and to model the major
  biochemical cycles of the land ecosystem. CABLE can be run as a standalone model
  for a single location or globally, or as part of an atmospheric model.

## Description

CABLE is a land surface model used to calculate fluxes of momentum, energy, water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere and to model the major biochemical cycles of the land ecosystem. CABLE can be run as a standalone model for a single location or globally, or as part of an atmospheric model.
