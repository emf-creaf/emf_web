summary: The LPJmL model is a dynamic gloval vegetation model designed to simulate
  the global terrestrial water and carbon cycles and the response of carbon and vegetation
  patterns under climate change. LPJmL simulate vegetation composition and distribution
  as well as stocks and land-atmosphere exchange flows of carbon and water, both for
  natural and agricultural ecosystems.

## Description

The LPJmL model is a dynamic gloval vegetation model designed to simulate the global terrestrial water and carbon cycles and the response of carbon and vegetation patterns under climate change. LPJmL simulate vegetation composition and distribution as well as stocks and land-atmosphere exchange flows of carbon and water, both for natural and agricultural ecosystems.
