summary: 4C is a model developed to describe long-term forest behaviour under changing
  environmental conditions. The model includes descriptions of tree species composition,
  forest structure, total ecosystem carbon content as well as leaf area index. The
  model shares a number of features with gap models, which have often been used for
  the simulation of long-term forest development. Establishment, growth and mortality
  of tree cohorts are explicitly modelled on a patch on which horizontal homogeneity
  is assumed. 4C requires climatic driving variables on a daily resolution but the
  outputs are given according to various time steps.

## Description

4C is a model developed to describe long-term forest behaviour under changing environmental conditions. The model includes descriptions of tree species composition, forest structure, total ecosystem carbon content as well as leaf area index. The model shares a number of features with gap models, which have often been used for the simulation of long-term forest development. Establishment, growth and mortality of tree cohorts are explicitly modelled on a patch on which horizontal homogeneity is assumed. 4C requires climatic driving variables on a daily resolution but the outputs are given according to various time steps.
