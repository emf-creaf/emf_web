summary: ED2 is an integrated terrestrial biosphere model incorporating hydrology,
  land-surface biophysics, vegetation dynamics, and soil carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry.
  Like ED, ED2 uses a set of size- and age-structured partial differential equations
  that track the changing structure and composition of the plant canopy.

## Description

ED2 is an integrated terrestrial biosphere model incorporating hydrology, land-surface biophysics, vegetation dynamics, and soil carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry. Like ED, ED2 uses a set of size- and age-structured partial differential equations that track the changing structure and composition of the plant canopy.
