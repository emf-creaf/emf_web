summary: CANOAK is a coupled biophysical and ecophysiolgical model that computes fluxes
  of water, heat and CO2 exchange within vegetation canopies and between the canopy
  and the atmosphere. In doing so CANOAK computes the canopy microclimate (light,
  wind, temperature, humidity and CO2), which provides drivers for physiological processes
  such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and stomatal conductance.

## Description

CANOAK is a coupled biophysical and ecophysiolgical model that computes fluxes of water, heat and CO2 exchange within vegetation canopies and between the canopy and the atmosphere. In doing so CANOAK computes the canopy microclimate (light, wind, temperature, humidity and CO2), which provides drivers for physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and stomatal conductance.
