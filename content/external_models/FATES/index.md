summary: FATES is a terrestrial ecosystem model that simulates and predicts growth,
  death and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions. When coupled
  into an earth system model, FATES allows representing potential ecosystem responses
  to environmental resource variability (water, light, nutrients), climate and atmospheric
  compositional changes.

## Description

FATES is a terrestrial ecosystem model that simulates and predicts growth, death and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions. When coupled into an earth system model, FATES allows representing potential ecosystem responses to environmental resource variability (water, light, nutrients), climate and atmospheric compositional changes.
