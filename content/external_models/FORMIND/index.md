summary: FORMIND is an individual-based vegetation model that simulates the growth
  of forests on the hectare scale. It allows to explore forest dynamics and forest
  structure including also processes like gap building. The main processes included
  in FORMIND are recruitment and establishment, mortality and growth. They depend
  on site-specific environmental conditions (temperature, insoolation, …). In addition,
  disturbances like fire events, forest fragmentation, logging or landslides can be
  activated.
