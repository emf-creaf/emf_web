summary: UVAFME is an individual-based gap model that simulates the annual establishment,
  growth, and mortality of individual trees on independent patches (i.e. plots) of
  a forested landscape. The model is only spatially distributed in the vertical dimension,
  and plots are assumed to have no direct spatial interactions with one another. Through
  a Monte Carlo-style aggregation, the average of several hundred of these independent
  patches represents the average expected conditions of a forested landscape through
  time.

## Description

UVAFME is an individual-based gap model that simulates the annual establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on independent patches (i.e. plots) of a forested landscape. The model is only spatially distributed in the vertical dimension, and plots are assumed to have no direct spatial interactions with one another. Through a Monte Carlo-style aggregation, the average of several hundred of these independent patches represents the average expected conditions of a forested landscape through time.
