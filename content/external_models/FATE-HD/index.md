summary: FATE is a spatially and temporally explicit vegetation model. It uses plant
  functional groups (PFG) and integrates important mechanisms driving vegetation dynamics,
  structure and diversity, such as demographic cycle, obviously, but also seeds dispersal,
  abiotic filtering or biotic interactions (through the competition for resources
  like light availability or soil nutrient availability).

## Description

FATE is a spatially and temporally explicit vegetation model. It uses plant functional groups (PFG) and integrates important mechanisms driving vegetation dynamics, structure and diversity, such as demographic cycle, obviously, but also seeds dispersal, abiotic filtering or biotic interactions (through the competition for resources like light availability or soil nutrient availability).
