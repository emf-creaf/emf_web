summary: JULES is a community land surface model that is used both as a standalone
  model and as the land surface component in UK's Met Office Unified Model. JULES
  has a tiled model of sub-grid heterogeneity with separate surface temperatures,
  short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground
  heat fluxes, canopy moisture contents, snow masses and snow melt rates computed
  for each surface type in a grid-box.

## Description

JULES is a community land surface model that is used both as a standalone model and as the land surface component in UK's Met Office Unified Model. JULES has a tiled model of sub-grid heterogeneity with separate surface temperatures, short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes, sensible and latent heat fluxes, ground heat fluxes, canopy moisture contents, snow masses and snow melt rates computed for each surface type in a grid-box.
