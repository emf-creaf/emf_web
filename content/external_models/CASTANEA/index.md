summary: 'CASTANEA is a physiological multilayer process-based model designed to predict
  the carbon balance of an even-aged, monospecific deciduous forest stand. The main
  output variables are: (1) leaf area index (LAI), standing biomass, soil carbon content
  and water content, which are state variables; and (2) canopy photosynthesis, maintenance
  respiration, growth of organs, growth respiration, soil heterotrophic respiration,
  transpiration and evapotranspiration, which are flux density variables'

## Description

CASTANEA is a physiological multilayer process-based model designed to predict the carbon balance of an even-aged, monospecific deciduous forest stand. The main output variables are: (1) leaf area index (LAI), standing biomass, soil carbon content and water content, which are state variables; and (2) canopy photosynthesis, maintenance respiration, growth of organs, growth respiration, soil heterotrophic respiration, transpiration and evapotranspiration, which are flux density variables
