summary: LINKAGES is a forest ecosystem biogeochemistry model that predicts long-term
  structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems as constrained by nitrogen availability,
  climate, and soil moisture. LINKAGES simulates ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage
  and cycling by considering the interactions between physiological processes that
  determine individual tree growth, demographic processes that determine tree-population
  dynamics, microbial processes that determine nitrogen availability, and environmental
  processes that determine water availability.

## Description

LINKAGES is a forest ecosystem biogeochemistry model that predicts long-term structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems as constrained by nitrogen availability, climate, and soil moisture. LINKAGES simulates ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and cycling by considering the interactions between physiological processes that determine individual tree growth, demographic processes that determine tree-population dynamics, microbial processes that determine nitrogen availability, and environmental processes that determine water availability.
