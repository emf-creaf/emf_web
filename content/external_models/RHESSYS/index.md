summary: RHESSYS is a GIS-based hydro-ecological modelling framework designed to simulate
  carbon, water and nutrient fluxes. By combining a set of physically-based process
  models and a methodology for partitioning and parameterizing the landscape, RHESSYS
  is capable of modelling the spatial distribution and spatio-temporal interactions
  between different processes at the watershed scale.

## Description

RHESSYS is a GIS-based hydro-ecological modelling framework designed to simulate carbon, water and nutrient fluxes. By combining a set of physically-based process models and a methodology for partitioning and parameterizing the landscape, RHESSYS is capable of modelling the spatial distribution and spatio-temporal interactions between different processes at the watershed scale.
