summary: The QUINCY model is a terrestrial biosphere model tracking the flows of carbon,
  nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as a number of isotopes for a number of pre-defined
  terrestrial ecosystem types at a half-hourly time-step. The objective of QUINCY
  is to clarify the role of the interacting terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus cycles
  and their effects on terrestrial C allocation and residence times as well as terrestrial
  water fluxes. It is currently developed to run for individual sites driven by surface
  meteorology, but its intention is to be further developed to be coupled to a land-surface
  scheme of a global climate model.

## Description

The QUINCY model is a terrestrial biosphere model tracking the flows of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as a number of isotopes for a number of pre-defined terrestrial ecosystem types at a half-hourly time-step. The objective of QUINCY is to clarify the role of the interacting terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and their effects on terrestrial C allocation and residence times as well as terrestrial water fluxes. It is currently developed to run for individual sites driven by surface meteorology, but its intention is to be further developed to be coupled to a land-surface scheme of a global climate model.
