summary: CenW is a generic growth and carbon cycling model that  simulates photosynthetic
  carbon gain, water use and the nitrogen cycle through soil organic matter. The photosynthetic
  modelling uses a simple, yet physiologically based, description of photosynthesis
  together with simple assumptions about light interception. Nitrogen turn-over is
  calculated with a modified version of the CENTURY model, which links organic carbon
  and nitrogen in soil organic matter pools and the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen
  in the soil with that in plants.

## Description

CenW is a generic growth and carbon cycling model that  simulates photosynthetic carbon gain, water use and the nitrogen cycle through soil organic matter. The photosynthetic modelling uses a simple, yet physiologically based, description of photosynthesis together with simple assumptions about light interception. Nitrogen turn-over is calculated with a modified version of the CENTURY model, which links organic carbon and nitrogen in soil organic matter pools and the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in the soil with that in plants.
