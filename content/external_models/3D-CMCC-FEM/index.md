summary: 3D-CMCC-FEM is a hybrid or fully bio-geochemical forest model that simulates
  storage and fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen including the dynamics occurring
  in forest ecosystems. The model is able to reproduce dynamics occurring in homogeneous
  and heterogeneous forests with different plant species, for different ages, diameters
  and height classes competing with each other for resources. The model simulates
  carbon fluxes in terms of gross and net primary production, partitioning and allocation
  in the main plant compartments (stem, branch, leaf, fruit, fine and coarse root,
  including non-structural carbon compounds). Nitrogen fluxes and allocation in the
  same carbon pools are also reproduced

## Description

3D-CMCC-FEM is a hybrid or fully bio-geochemical forest model that simulates storage and fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen including the dynamics occurring in forest ecosystems. The model is able to reproduce dynamics occurring in homogeneous and heterogeneous forests with different plant species, for different ages, diameters and height classes competing with each other for resources. The model simulates carbon fluxes in terms of gross and net primary production, partitioning and allocation in the main plant compartments (stem, branch, leaf, fruit, fine and coarse root, including non-structural carbon compounds). Nitrogen fluxes and allocation in the same carbon pools are also reproduced
