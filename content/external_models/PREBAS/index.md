summary: PREBAS is a forest growth and ecosystem carbon balance model. In PREBAS three
  different models PRELES (PREdict Light-use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil
  water), CROBAS (Tree growth and CROwn BASe from carbon balance), and YASSO (Yet
  Another Simulator of Soil Organic matter) are coupled together in order to predict
  the growth and carbon balance of the forest ecosystem. CROBAS provides estimates
  of LAI (Leaf Area Index) that is used in PRELES to compute gross primary production.
  GPP is then used by CROBAS to estimate forest growth. The stand structural variables
  and the biomass components of the forest are updated. Meanwhile, CROBAS estimates
  the litter production that is the input of YASSO.

## Description

PREBAS is a forest growth and ecosystem carbon balance model. In PREBAS three different models PRELES (PREdict Light-use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil water), CROBAS (Tree growth and CROwn BASe from carbon balance), and YASSO (Yet Another Simulator of Soil Organic matter) are coupled together in order to predict the growth and carbon balance of the forest ecosystem. CROBAS provides estimates of LAI (Leaf Area Index) that is used in PRELES to compute gross primary production. GPP is then used by CROBAS to estimate forest growth. The stand structural variables and the biomass components of the forest are updated. Meanwhile, CROBAS estimates the litter production that is the input of YASSO.
