summary: MuSICA is a model primarily developed to simulate the exchanges of mass (water,
  CO2) and energy in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum. Stand structure is
  explicitly accounted for and competition for light and water between species can
  be explored. The model typically produces output at a 30-min time step and can be
  run over multiple years or decades as long as the vegetation structure is given.

## Description

MuSICA is a model primarily developed to simulate the exchanges of mass (water, CO2) and energy in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum. Stand structure is explicitly accounted for and competition for light and water between species can be explored. The model typically produces output at a 30-min time step and can be run over multiple years or decades as long as the vegetation structure is given.
