summary: MAIDEN is an ecophysiological model that was created to explore the relationships
  between climate variability and forest growth-productivity. The simulations can
  be verified using different data to validate the different processes in the model,
  including dendroecological growth data, 13C and 18O data and measurements of ecosystem
  carbon and water fluxes.

## Description

MAIDEN is an ecophysiological model that was created to explore the relationships between climate variability and forest growth-productivity. The simulations can be verified using different data to validate the different processes in the model, including dendroecological growth data, 13C and 18O data and measurements of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes.
