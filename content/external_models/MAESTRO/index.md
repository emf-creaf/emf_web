summary: MAESTRO/MAESTRA is a 3D model of forest canopy radiation absorption and photosynthesis.
  The forest canopy is represented in the model as an array of tree crowns, whose
  positions and dimensions are specified, but calculations are done for a target crown.

## Description

MAESTRO/MAESTRA is a 3D model of forest canopy radiation absorption and photosynthesis. The forest canopy is represented in the model as an array of tree crowns, whose positions and dimensions are specified, but calculations are done for a target crown.
