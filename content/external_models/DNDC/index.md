summary: DNDC is a computer simulation model of carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry
  in agro-ecosystems. The model can be used for predicting crop growth, soil temperature
  and moisture regimes, soil carbon dynamics, nitrogen leaching, and emissions of
  trace gases including nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), dinitrogen (N2), ammonia
  (NH3), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
