summary: JABOWA is a forest model developed in 1970 by Daniel B. Botkin, and James
  F. Janak and James R. Wallis. Since this, this kind of model is known among ecologists
  as "gap model" . The model simulates the growth of individual trees on small plots,
  as a function of forest structure and environmental variables such as elevation,
  rainfall and soil properties.
