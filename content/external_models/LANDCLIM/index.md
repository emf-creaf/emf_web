summary: LandClim is a stochastic process-based model designed to study spatially
  explicit forest dynamics at the landscape scale over long time periods with a fine
  spatial resolution. The tree growth processes are based on a simplified version
  of the forest gap model FORCLIM. At the landscape scale, LandClim simulates processes
  that occur across grid cells, including seed dispersal, disturbances and forest
  management regimes.

## Description

LandClim is a stochastic process-based model designed to study spatially explicit forest dynamics at the landscape scale over long time periods with a fine spatial resolution. The tree growth processes are based on a simplified version of the forest gap model FORCLIM. At the landscape scale, LandClim simulates processes that occur across grid cells, including seed dispersal, disturbances and forest management regimes.
