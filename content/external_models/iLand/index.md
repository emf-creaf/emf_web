summary: iLand is a model of forest landscape dynamics, simulating individual tree
  competition, growth, mortality, and regeneration. It addresses interactions between
  climate (change), disturbance regimes, vegetation dynamics, and forest management.  In
  iLand, forest dynamics is modeled as an emergent property of interactions between
  adaptive agents, and their environment. iLand is a multi-scale process-based model,
  integrating processes from the individual tree level (e.g., competition) to the
  landscape scale (e.g., disturbance) in a hierarchical simulation framework.

## Description

iLand is a model of forest landscape dynamics, simulating individual tree competition, growth, mortality, and regeneration. It addresses interactions between climate (change), disturbance regimes, vegetation dynamics, and forest management.  In iLand, forest dynamics is modeled as an emergent property of interactions between adaptive agents, and their environment. iLand is a multi-scale process-based model, integrating processes from the individual tree level (e.g., competition) to the landscape scale (e.g., disturbance) in a hierarchical simulation framework.
