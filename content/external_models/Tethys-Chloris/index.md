summary: Tethys-Chloris is a physical-based mechanistic tool developed to account
  for the coupled interactions of energy-water-vegetation in a variety of environments
  and climates where water is the key component. Energy and mass exchanges in the
  atmospheric surface layer are treated thoroughly with an accurate resistance analogy
  scheme. A simplified module of saturated and unsaturated soil water dynamics governs
  the subsurface hydrology.  Up to two layers of vegetation (e.g. trees and grasses)
  can be accounted for. In cold environment a snowpack evolution module controls the
  energy exchanges, the snow accumulation and the snow melting that can be eventually
  mediated by vegetation interactions. Vegetation structure and dynamics are parsimoniously
  parameterizes including plant life-cycle processes, photosynthesis, phenology, carbon
  allocation and tissues turnover.

## Description

Tethys-Chloris is a physical-based mechanistic tool developed to account for the coupled interactions of energy-water-vegetation in a variety of environments and climates where water is the key component. Energy and mass exchanges in the atmospheric surface layer are treated thoroughly with an accurate resistance analogy scheme. A simplified module of saturated and unsaturated soil water dynamics governs the subsurface hydrology.  Up to two layers of vegetation (e.g. trees and grasses) can be accounted for. In cold environment a snowpack evolution module controls the energy exchanges, the snow accumulation and the snow melting that can be eventually mediated by vegetation interactions. Vegetation structure and dynamics are parsimoniously parameterizes including plant life-cycle processes, photosynthesis, phenology, carbon allocation and tissues turnover.
