summary: ORCHIDEE is the land surface model of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace,
  and can be run as a stand alone terrestrial biosphere model in a coupled set-up.
  The model includes processes to quantify terrestrial water, carbon and energy balances.
  Anthropogenic interferences includes land cover changes, fire, crop irrigation and
  forest/grassland management.

## Description

ORCHIDEE is the land surface model of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, and can be run as a stand alone terrestrial biosphere model in a coupled set-up. The model includes processes to quantify terrestrial water, carbon and energy balances. Anthropogenic interferences includes land cover changes, fire, crop irrigation and forest/grassland management.
