summary: LANDIS PRO is a raster-based forest landscape model (FLM) that evolved over
  15 years of development and applications of the LANDIS model. Within each raster
  cell, the model records number of trees by species age cohort, and size (e.g., DBH)
  of each age cohort, which is derived from empirical age-DBH relationships. LANDIS
  PRO incorporates species-, stand-, and landscape-scale processes. Species- and stand-scale
  processes are simulated within each cell, and landscape-scale processes are simulated
  across the whole landscape, in addition these three scales interact with each other.

## Description

LANDIS PRO is a raster-based forest landscape model (FLM) that evolved over 15 years of development and applications of the LANDIS model. Within each raster cell, the model records number of trees by species age cohort, and size (e.g., DBH) of each age cohort, which is derived from empirical age-DBH relationships. LANDIS PRO incorporates species-, stand-, and landscape-scale processes. Species- and stand-scale processes are simulated within each cell, and landscape-scale processes are simulated across the whole landscape, in addition these three scales interact with each other.
