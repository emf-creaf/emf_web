summary: MILLENIAL is a soil model developed to simulate C pools that can be measured
  by extraction or fractionation, including particulate organic C, mineral-associated
  organic C, aggregate C, microbial biomass, and low molecular weight C. Model processes
  have been updated to reflect the current understanding of mineral-association, temperature
  sensitivity and reaction kinetics.

## Description

MILLENIAL is a soil model developed to simulate C pools that can be measured by extraction or fractionation, including particulate organic C, mineral-associated organic C, aggregate C, microbial biomass, and low molecular weight C. Model processes have been updated to reflect the current understanding of mineral-association, temperature sensitivity and reaction kinetics.
