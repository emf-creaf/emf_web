summary: KEYLINK is a soil model integrating new knowledge on soil structure and its
  importance for soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization and hydrology, with the existing
  concepts on SOM pools, and elements from food web models, i.e. those from direct
  trophic interactions among soil organisms.
