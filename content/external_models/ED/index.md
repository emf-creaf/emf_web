summary: ED is an individual-based model of vegetation dynamics with integrated submodels
  of plant growth, mortality, phenology, disturbance, hydrology and soil biogeochemistry.
  individual plants of different functional types compete mechanistically in ED under
  local environmental conditions.

## Description

ED is an individual-based model of vegetation dynamics with integrated submodels of plant growth, mortality, phenology, disturbance, hydrology and soil biogeochemistry. individual plants of different functional types compete mechanistically in ED under local environmental conditions.
