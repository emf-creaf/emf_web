summary: The LANDIS-II forest landscape model simulates forests (both trees and shrubs)
  at decadal to multi-century time scales and spatial scales spanning hundreds to
  millions of hectares. The model simulates change as a function of growth and succession
  and, optionally, as they are influenced by range of disturbances (e.g., fire, wind,
  insects), forest management, land use change.

## Description

The LANDIS-II forest landscape model simulates forests (both trees and shrubs) at decadal to multi-century time scales and spatial scales spanning hundreds to millions of hectares. The model simulates change as a function of growth and succession and, optionally, as they are influenced by range of disturbances (e.g., fire, wind, insects), forest management, land use change.
