summary: CLASSIC is a land surface model that simulates the exchanges of energy, water,
  carbon, and momentum at the earth's surface. CLASSIC is formed by the coupling of
  the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem
  Model (CTEM). CLASS handles the model physics including fluxes of energy, water
  and momentum. CTEM simulates biogeochemical cycles including fluxes of carbon.

## Description

CLASSIC is a land surface model that simulates the exchanges of energy, water, carbon, and momentum at the earth's surface. CLASSIC is formed by the coupling of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM). CLASS handles the model physics including fluxes of energy, water and momentum. CTEM simulates biogeochemical cycles including fluxes of carbon.
