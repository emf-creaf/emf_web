abstract = {Abstract Mountain species are at the forefront of climate change disruption, and montane saproxylic Coleoptera are facing large- and small-scale changes in their surroundings. Saproxylic Coleoptera are both functionally and taxonomically diverse and are the representatives of an imperilled fauna confronted with the realities of a changing landscape. Understanding the effects of elevation and other forest characteristics on saproxylic and non-saproxylic Coleoptera is a step towards predicting the future of taxonomic and functional group biodiversity at the tree-line and on mountains. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of elevation and other forest characteristics on the biodiversity of montane Coleoptera at the tree-line using both taxonomic and functional feeding guild classifications. Our results suggest that abundance of saprotrophs is closely linked to the density of large trees rather than the volume of wood. Edge effects and elevation seem to drive abundance patterns of some species and also influence taxonomic and functional guild community patterns differently. Finally, we discuss the implications of climate change and land abandonment to future Coleoptera community structure.}
