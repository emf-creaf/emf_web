	abstract = {Tree growth is a key uncertainty in projections of forest productivity and the global carbon cycle. While global vegetation models commonly represent tree growth as a carbon assimilation (source)-driven process, accumu­ lating evidence points toward widespread non-photosynthetic (sink) limitations. Notably, growth biophysical potential, defined as the upper-limit to tree growth imposed by temperature and turgor constraints on cell di­ vision, has been suggested to be a potent driver of observed decoupling between tree growth and photosynthesis. Understanding the interplay between biophysical potential and photosynthesis and how to accommodate it parsimoniously in models remains a challenge.},
