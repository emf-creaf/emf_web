summary: Simulation of water balance of soils and plants within forest stands. Medfate
  also allows simulating plant growth, mortality and recruitment processes of a set
  of cohorts competing for light and water within a forest stand. Finally, it also
  allows relating the amount of plant biomass and the water status of plant tissues
  to fuel characteristics and, hence, fire hazard.

## Description

Simulation of water balance of soils and plants within forest stands. Medfate also allows simulating plant growth, mortality and recruitment processes of a set of cohorts competing for light and water within a forest stand. Finally, it also allows relating the amount of plant biomass and the water status of plant tissues to fuel characteristics and, hence, fire hazard.
