summary: This course is intended as an introduction to git and control version systems in general. We will see how to use git efficiently in several scenarios (individual work, collaborations…) and explain the basics of the git workflow as well as also more advanced techniques (branches, merges, pull requests...). Finally, we will introduce how to use available online services (GitHub, GitLab…) that allows us to store and share our git repositories.
