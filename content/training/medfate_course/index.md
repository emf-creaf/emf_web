summary: "The main aims of the course are: (a) to provide participants with the basis to understand the formulation and parameterization of biophysical, physiological and ecological processes in the models of forest water balance, carbon balance and forest dynamics included in the R package medfate; (b) to show how to use medfate and medfateland R packages to prepare model inputs, perform simulations of forest function and dynamics at stand to regional scales."
