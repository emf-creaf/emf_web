summary: The aim of this course is to become familiar working with spatial data in R. In the first half of the course we will show how we can load and inspect vector and raster data from within your R session. This also includes basic vector operations, like e.g. spatial joins and filters, raster algebra (merge, extractâ€¦) as well as some basic visualization techniques. In the second half of the course, we will illustrate the use of spatial data in statistical analysis like e.g. raster interpolation, point pattern analysis and krigging.
