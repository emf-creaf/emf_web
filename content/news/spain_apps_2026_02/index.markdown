CREAF-EMF's [Laboratori Forestal](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat) has published two new web
apps, [Meteoland App](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat/meteoland_app) and
[Forestdrought App](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat/forestdrought_app). These apps show data
for Spain at 500 m² for the last 365 days:

  - **Meteoland App**: Meteorological data interpolated from Spanish meteorological services
  (AEMET, Meteocat, Meteogalicia, RIA) to continuous landscape (500 m²).  
  - **Forestdorught App**: Modelled forest water balance and fire risk indexes at the same
  resolution.  

## Data is also available

The web apps are not the only way to access the data, though they are a nice way to
visualize it. For those interested directly in the data, it is available in the
[EMF public data repository](https://data-emf.creaf.cat/public/gpkg/).
