summary: "`forestables` R package provides tools to download and extract tidy data from the US, France and Sapin forest inventories"  
---

We are proud of announcing the `forestables` R package.  
`forestables` allows accessing and using forest inventory data in analyses, applications or
models. All forest inventories data is uniformized, so data from different inventories can
be used together (*i.e.* mediterranean areas of Spain and France).
Take a look at the [documentation](https://emf-creaf.github.io/forestables/) to get started!
