Five years ago the *Laboratori Forestal Català* (LFC) web was launched. At the
time only the *IFN App* was available, but soon enough others followed (*LiDAR App*, *Allometr App*...). Slowly but constantly new data and
applications have been added over these years, to reach the actual state of the
LFC.  
A lot has changed in these five years, most of it underneath the surface, but
it was time for a new face.
