We are proud to announce that DEBOSCAT 2022 data is finally included in the app and available to visualize and download. 

Gathered by *Agents Rurals* from the Catalan government and cleaned and curated by experts at CREAF and the EMF,
[DEBOSCAT](https://www.creaf.cat/es/red-de-seguimiento-del-estado-de-los-bosques-de-cataluna-decaimiento-de-los-bosques-de-cataluna)
decay data offers a unique view of the temporal effects of the drought in the Catalonian forests.  
[DEBOSCAT App](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat/deboscat_app/) presents drought forest decay data starting from
2012. Data is updated every year after the field campaigns ends and a quality control assesment is performed.
