[DEBOSCAT App](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat/deboscat_app/) has been updated with the 2023
campaign data, offering now 12 consecutive years of data (from 2012 to 2023)!!

In case you don't know yet, [DEBOSCAT](https://www.creaf.cat/es/red-de-seguimiento-del-estado-de-los-bosques-de-cataluna-decaimiento-de-los-bosques-de-cataluna)
data is possible thanks to the field surveys of *Agents Rurals* from the Catalan government and
cleaned and curated by experts at CREAF. It offers a unique view of the temporal effects of the
drought in the Catalonian forests.

So if you want to see how forests coped with drought last year, go to the
[DEBOSCAT App](https://laboratoriforestal.creaf.cat/deboscat_app/) and explore the newly added
data.
