`meteoland` R package, which provides utilities to estimate daily weather variables at any position over complex terrains has been
updated to version `2.0.0`.  
This version of `meteoland` introduces a very small change but with a huge impact. Now building big
meteo interpolators (20 years, 100 stations) takes seconds instead of minutes. This just makes easier
and faster to use `meteoland` in *real-time* modelling applications.

Read all changes made in this version [here](https://emf-creaf.github.io/meteoland/news/index.html).
