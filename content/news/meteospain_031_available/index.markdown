summary: "`meteospain` R package, a library designed for accessing the Spanish meteorology stations data, has been updated to version 0.3.1, fixing access to MeteoGalicia data."  
---

`meteospain`, the R package to access data of Spanish meteorology stations, reachs version
*0.3.1*.  
This update fixes some recent problems with MeteoGalicia API, as well as improves the responses in
the RIA API. Also, a new `get_variables_from` method has been added, that returns metadata for
the variables returned by the APIs (currently, only working in MeteoCat).

Don't forget to check the [docs](https://emf-creaf.github.io/meteospain/) for a full guide into using
`meteospain`.
