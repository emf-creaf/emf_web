We are proud to announce that a new scientific publication appeared recently, related to the model development activity carried out at the Ecosystem Modelling Facility:

De Cáceres M, Molowny-Horas R, Cabon A, Martínez-Vilalta J, Mencuccini M, García-Valdés R, Nadal-Sala D, Sabaté S, Martin-StPaul N, Morin X, D'Adamo F, Batllori E, Améztegui A (2023) **MEDFATE 2.9.3: A trait-enabled model to simulate Mediterranean forest function and dynamics at regional scales**. *Geoscientific Model Development* 16, 3165–3201 (https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3165-2023).

This publication presents new simulation models offered in the MEDFATE package for the processes of carbon balance, growth, mortality and recruitment. The publication also presents the procedures employed for parametrization and evaluation of the new models and an application to project forest dynamics in Catalonia.
