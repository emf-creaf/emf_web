*Improving access to FORest GENetic Resources Information and Services for End-USers (FORGENIUS)* [project](https://www.forgenius.eu/)
has among its objectives to create innovative data accesibility and modelling services. 

This workshop, co-organized between CREAF-EMF and INRAe, focused on discussing initialisation and parameterization of process-based models (especially in terms of hydraulic traits). The workshop has helped to unify efforts by establishing future lines of process based model developments, with the aim to obtain better projections of forest responses to global change.
