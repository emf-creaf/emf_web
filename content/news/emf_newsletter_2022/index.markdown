  + **NABBS** [https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/index.cfm]: Cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service to monitor the status and trends of North American bird populations. 
  + **RCP database** [https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/RcpDb/]: The RCP database aims at documenting the emissions, concentrations, and land-cover change projections of the so-called "Representative Concentration Pathways".
  + **PaleoClim** [http://www.paleoclim.org/]: High-resolution paleoclimate data for use in biological modeling and GIS.

### Models added to the EMF catalog

  + **FORCAsT** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4776662]: FORest Canopy Atmosphere Transfer model is a canopy model capable of simulating the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from biogenic VOC oxidation.
  + **FORCEEPS** [http://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/help_en/forceeps]: A forest community model for woody species (Angiosperms and Gymnosperms). Inspired by the gap model ForClim, deals with environmental and biotic filtering of forest communities and ecosystem processes such as biomass production.
